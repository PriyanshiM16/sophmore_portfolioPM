   <p> Hello, my name is Priyanshi malik. As of right now I am in my sophmore year of highschool. I am doing really good in all my classes.

  Even though some classes are difficult, high school has taught me to work through thick and thin and in the end succeed. High school right now is really fun.
     <br>
   I have joined many clubs inclding my school volleyball team. i am also planning on joining a program called skillsUSA. In my classes i am also doing
     <br>
     "web and develpoment class" which baiscally means i learn how to code and create websites. This class is one of my favorite classes in school. 
     <br>
     Aside from school, i am a nice and outgoing person.
