  <hr><p> Hello, my name is Priyanshi malik. As of right now I am in my sophomore year of high school. I am doing really good in all my classes.
     <br>
  Even though some classes are difficult including my math and science classes, high school has taught me to work through thick and thin and in the end, succeed. High school right now is really fun.
     <br>
   I have joined many clubs inclding my school volleyball team. I am also planning on joining a program called <a href="https://www.skillsusa.org/" target="_blank">SkillsUSA</a>. In my classes I am also doing
     <br>
     "web and develpoment" class which basically means I learn how to code and create websites. This class is one of my favorite classes in school. 
     <br>
     Aside from school, I am a nice and outgoing person.
     Some things I like are food, drawing, art, crocheting, knitting, and playing volleyball and I love swimming. </p><hr>
